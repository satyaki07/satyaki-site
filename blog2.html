          Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question
        </h1>

        <p class="blog-text">
          <span class="first-letter">T</span>he most well-known dummy text is
          the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th
          century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more
          or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real
          Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it
          imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. The
          advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of
          Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or
          distract the viewer's attention from the layout.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Certain internet providers exploit the fact that fill text cannot be
          recognized by automatic search engines - meaningful information cannot
          be distinguished from meaningless: Target-generated dummy text mixed
          with a certain combination of search terms can lead to an increased
          frequency of visits by search machine users. As a consequence,
          advertising revenues, which rely on website 'hits', are increased.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Dummy copy is great, but whatâ€™s with all the Latin? Turns out, the
          original Lorem Ipsum comes from bits and pieces of Ciceroâ€™s De Finibus
          bonorum et Malorum (On the Ends of Goods and Evils). We work for good,
          we said to ourselves, so why not create filler text thatâ€™s just the
          good and not the evil? And maybe in a more comprehensible language?
          Thus was born Social Good Ipsum. We pulled words and phrases from the
          humanitarian, social impact, nonprofit sectors, to come up with
          winning chunks of filler text: Equal opportunity mobilize; Global,
          accessibility, fairness NGO support; technology. Invest billionaire
          philanthropy humanitarian relief natural resources outcomes. Peaceful
          overcome injustice collaborative cities, gender rights youth
          change-makers save the world.
