            The usefulness of nonsensical content

        <p class="blog-text">
          <span class="first-letter">D</span>ummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Certain internet providers exploit the fact that fill text cannot be
          recognized by automatic search engines - meaningful information cannot
          be distinguished from meaningless: Target-generated dummy text mixed
          with a certain combination of search terms can lead to an increased
          frequency of visits by search machine users. As a consequence,
          advertising revenues, which rely on website 'hits', are increased.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Dummy copy is great, but whatâ€™s with all the Latin? Turns out, the
          original Lorem Ipsum comes from bits and pieces of Ciceroâ€™s De Finibus
          bonorum et Malorum (On the Ends of Goods and Evils). We work for good,
          we said to ourselves, so why not create filler text thatâ€™s just the
          good and not the evil? And maybe in a more comprehensible language?
          Thus was born Social Good Ipsum. We pulled words and phrases from the
          humanitarian, social impact, nonprofit sectors, to come up with
          winning chunks of filler text: Equal opportunity mobilize; Global,
          accessibility, fairness NGO support; technology. Invest billionaire
          philanthropy humanitarian relief natural resources outcomes. Peaceful
          overcome injustice collaborative cities, gender rights youth
          change-makers save the world.
