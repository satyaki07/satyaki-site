          Automatic recognition of Lorem Ipsum during the pre-press workflow
        </h1>

          <span class="first-letter">T</span>he spread of computers and layout programmes thus made dummy text
          better known. While in earlier times several lines of the Lorem Ipsum
          text were repeated in the creation of dummy texts, today the full text
          of Cicero's 'De finibus' serves as the basis for many dummy text or
          Lorem Ipsum generators. Based on 'De finibus', these generators
          automatically create longer sections of the Lorem Ipsum text or
          various other filler texts. The phrasal sequence of the Lorem Ipsum
          text is now so widespread and commonplace that many DTP programmes can
          generate dummy text using the starting sequence "Lorem ipsum".
          Fortunately, the phrase 'Lorem Ipsum' is now recognized by electronic
          pre-press systems and, when found, an alarm can be raised. This avoids
          a publication going to print with overlooked dummy text.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Certain internet providers exploit the fact that fill text cannot be
          recognized by automatic search engines - meaningful information cannot
          be distinguished from meaningless: Target-generated dummy text mixed
          with a certain combination of search terms can lead to an increased
          frequency of visits by search machine users. As a consequence,
          advertising revenues, which rely on website 'hits', are increased.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Dummy copy is great, but whatâ€™s with all the Latin? Turns out, the
          original Lorem Ipsum comes from bits and pieces of Ciceroâ€™s De Finibus
          bonorum et Malorum (On the Ends of Goods and Evils). We work for good,
          we said to ourselves, so why not create filler text thatâ€™s just the
          good and not the evil? And maybe in a more comprehensible language?
          Thus was born Social Good Ipsum. We pulled words and phrases from the
          humanitarian, social impact, nonprofit sectors, to come up with
          winning chunks of filler text: Equal opportunity mobilize; Global,
          accessibility, fairness NGO support; technology. Invest billionaire
          philanthropy humanitarian relief natural resources outcomes. Peaceful
          overcome injustice collaborative cities, gender rights youth
          change-makers save the world.
